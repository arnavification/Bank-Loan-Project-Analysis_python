# Bank Loan Data Analysis

## About the Project

This project is an **end-to-end data analysis of bank loan applications** aimed at understanding customer behavior, financial risk, and portfolio health.

Banks operate in a high-risk environment where every loan decision affects profitability and credit exposure. By systematically analyzing historical loan data, we can:

* Track loan performance and repayment patterns
* Identify **Good vs Bad Loans**
* Understand borrower characteristics (employment, income, home ownership, loan purpose)
* Detect **seasonality and regional trends** in lending
* Support data-driven credit policies

The dataset provided is large:

* **Full dataset:** 38,000+ loan records (uploaded but not previewable on GitHub)
* **Sample dataset:** \~1,500 rows for quick testing, reproducibility, and public preview

This ensures anyone can explore the analysis easily without needing to download the massive file.

## Problem Statement

### **Business Requirement Document (BRD 1): KPI Summary**

The first goal was to compute key banking metrics that provide an **at-a-glance understanding of lending activities**:

* **Loan Applications** â†’ Total and Month-to-Date (MTD) counts
* **Funded Amounts** â†’ Total funds disbursed and MTD breakdown
* **Payments Received** â†’ Total repayments collected and MTD tracking
* **Portfolio Health** â†’

  * *Average Interest Rate* â†’ benchmark lending cost
  * *Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio* â†’ borrowersâ€™ repayment capacity
* **Loan Quality** â†’ Segmentation into *Good vs Bad Loans*, capturing:

  * Application %
  * Counts
  * Funded amounts
  * Repayments

These KPIs form the **core health dashboard for bank management**.

### **Business Requirement Document (BRD 2): Visualization Overview**

The second goal was to build **clear, business-facing visuals** to uncover patterns in the loan portfolio:

* **Monthly Trends by Issue Date** â†’ Detecting seasonal peaks and troughs in lending
* **Regional Analysis by State** â†’ Identifying high-volume and high-risk geographies
* **Loan Term Analysis** â†’ Comparing borrower preference between short-term (36 months) vs long-term (60 months) loans
* **Employment Length Analysis** â†’ Measuring how job stability influences loan approval and repayment
* **Loan Purpose Breakdown** â†’ Understanding the primary drivers behind loan demand (e.g., debt consolidation, credit card repayment, home improvement)
* **Home Ownership Analysis** â†’ Studying how home ownership status affects loan disbursement and repayment patterns

These visualizations transform raw data into **business intelligence**, giving decision-makers both a macro and micro view of portfolio dynamics.

## Key Insights & Business Value

* ðŸ“Œ **Seasonality** â†’ Loan disbursements showed consistent monthly spikes, indicating consumer borrowing behavior linked to certain periods.
* ðŸ“Œ **Loan Purpose** â†’ Debt consolidation dominated the portfolio, highlighting customer reliance on loans for financial restructuring.
* ðŸ“Œ **Employment Length** â†’ Borrowers with longer work experience exhibited lower default tendencies, validating employment as a key risk factor.
* ðŸ“Œ **Home Ownership** â†’ Borrowers with mortgages had a unique risk-return profile compared to those owning or renting homes.
* ðŸ“Œ **Good vs Bad Loans** â†’ Segmentation provided a **direct measure of portfolio risk**, helping in predictive credit modeling.
* ðŸ“Œ **Regional Disparities** â†’ Certain states contributed disproportionately to loan applications, suggesting targeted credit policies are required.

Together, these findings help banks **optimize approval policies, monitor risks, and strengthen long-term portfolio health**.

##  Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **data analysis transforms raw banking data into actionable insights**. By combining KPIs, borrower segmentation, and visualization, we:

* Created a **comprehensive loan portfolio dashboard**
* Identified **key borrower attributes affecting repayment**
* Highlighted **macro trends (seasonality, geography, purpose)**
* Distinguished **Good vs Bad Loans for better credit strategy**

The framework can be extended to build **predictive models** for loan default probability, automate risk scoring, and design **data-driven lending strategies**.
